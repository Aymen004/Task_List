Simple python project task list Explained:


1. **To-Do List Class (`ToDoList`):**
   - The `ToDoList` class represents a to-do list and has methods for adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, viewing tasks, saving tasks to a file, and loading tasks from a file.
   - Each task in the list is represented as a dictionary with keys "task" and "completed."

2. **Main Function (`main`):**
   - The `main` function serves as the entry point of the program.
   - It creates an instance of the `ToDoList` class and provides a simple menu for the user to interact with the to-do list.
   - The user can choose options to add a task, mark a task as completed, view the to-do list, save the to-do list to a file, or quit the application.

3. **User Interaction:**
   - The user is prompted to enter a choice (a number between 1 and 5) based on the available options in the menu.
   - Depending on the user's choice, the program executes the corresponding action, such as adding a task, marking a task as completed, viewing the to-do list, saving to a file, or quitting the application.

4. **File Operations:**
   - The to-do list can be saved to a JSON file (`todolist.json`) and loaded from the file. This allows users to persist their tasks between program runs.

5. **Looping Structure:**
   - The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to quit. This allows the user to perform multiple operations in a single session.

Overall, this To-Do List application provides a basic but functional way for users to manage their tasks through a command-line interface. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, view the current list, save it to a file, and reload it from a file in subsequent sessions.
